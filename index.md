This group is for anyone who is interested in Linux and talking about it with your neighbors.
We have bi-weekly meet-ups and are currently meeting at the West Seattle &
Fauntleroy YMCA. You can find out more information on our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WSeaLUG/)
page or join us on our [slack channel](https://wsealug-slack-signup.herokuapp.com/).

At the meetings, we either have a ['Lean-Coffee'](http://leancoffee.org/) style of a meeting, or one of our members will give a 30-45 minute demonstration of something GNU/Linux related. We are keeping track of these and suggestions on a
public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/duBE2Tpr/wsealug).

We will soon have records and slide-decks of past presentations, stay tuned!

Thanks for checking us out, and we hope to see you at the next meet up.

WSeaLUG Leadership Team!
