Anyone who is interested in Linux and talking about it with your neighbors.
We have bi-weekly meet-ups and are currently meeting at the West Seattle &
Fauntleroy YMCA. You can find out more information on our [meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/WSeaLUG/)
page.

At each meeting we have a 30 minute demonstration of something
GNU/Linux related. We are keeping track of these and suggestions on a
public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/duBE2Tpr/wsealug">https://trello.com/b/duBE2Tpr/wsealug).

Thanks for checking us out, and we hope to see you at the next meet up.

WSeaLug Leadership Team!
